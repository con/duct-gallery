# Feature Specification: con/duct Examples Gallery

**Feature Branch**: `001-a-want-a`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "A want a registry of examples for use of con/duct (https://github.com/con/duct) tool which we generated ourselves or found online. And then accompany such examples with plots, potentially with some custom options to the `con-duct plot` command.  Examples should have also references to github repositories or datalad datasets on which they were ran and produced.  And allow for tags for each example so we could potentially group them. As a result such galery should populate local copy of the con/duct logs fetched from pointed online resources, and then renderings of those con/duct logs as images to be included in a README.md file"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Feature description provided
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Identified: registry, examples, plots, tags, fetching, rendering
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ User flows defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Requirements generated
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ All checks passed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A researcher or developer wants to collect and showcase examples of con/duct tool usage. They discover con/duct log files from various GitHub repositories or DataLad datasets (either self-generated or found online), download them locally, generate visualization plots from those logs, and organize everything into a browseable markdown gallery with tags for categorization. The gallery displays each example with its source reference, log data, and rendered plot images.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a GitHub repository URL containing con/duct logs, **When** the user adds it to the gallery registry, **Then** the system fetches the log files locally and stores metadata about the source
2. **Given** a local con/duct log file, **When** the user generates a gallery entry, **Then** the system creates plot images using `con-duct plot` command with specified options
3. **Given** multiple examples with tags, **When** the user views the gallery README.md, **Then** examples are organized by tags with embedded plot images and source references
4. **Given** an example entry, **When** viewing its details, **Then** the user sees the GitHub/DataLad source reference, tags, and plot images
5. **Given** custom plot options, **When** generating an example's plots, **Then** the plots reflect the specified customizations

### Concrete Example
**Title**: "con/duct Demo Example"

**Source Repository**: https://github.com/con/duct/

**Log Files** (from specific commit a539c3e):
- Info file: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/con/duct/a539c3e20cccd4455a75cd7bfbae9cd644cdcbff/demo/example_output_info.json`
- Related files referenced in `output_paths`:
  - `demo/example_output_usage.json` ‚Üí `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/con/duct/a539c3e20cccd4455a75cd7bfbae9cd644cdcbff/demo/example_output_usage.json`
  - `demo/example_output_stdout` ‚Üí `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/con/duct/a539c3e20cccd4455a75cd7bfbae9cd644cdcbff/demo/example_output_stdout`
  - `demo/example_output_stderr` ‚Üí `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/con/duct/a539c3e20cccd4455a75cd7bfbae9cd644cdcbff/demo/example_output_stderr`

**Tags**: `synthetic`, `medium-length`

**Expected Behavior**: System fetches all four files to local storage, generates SVG plot using `con-duct plot` on the usage data, creates an entry in README.md under both "synthetic" and "medium-length" tag sections with hyperlinks to the example's detailed section, displays the plot image, and includes a link back to https://github.com/con/duct/

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a referenced online resource (GitHub repo/DataLad dataset) is unavailable or moved?
- How does the system handle invalid or corrupted con/duct log files?
- What happens when the same example is added multiple times from different sources?
- How are plot generation failures handled (e.g., incompatible log format, missing data)?
- What happens when tags are renamed or merged?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain a registry of con/duct example entries
- **FR-002**: System MUST fetch con/duct log files from online resources (GitHub repositories, DataLad datasets) to local storage OR use local file paths directly
- **FR-003**: System MUST parse the `output_paths` field from con/duct info JSON files to discover and fetch all related log files (usage, stdout, stderr) from remote sources OR resolve them as local relative paths
- **FR-004**: System MAY store references to the source location (GitHub repo URL, DataLad dataset identifier) for each example; source_repo is optional and may be empty for local-only examples
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate plot images from con/duct logs using the `con-duct plot` command
- **FR-006**: System MUST support passing an arbitrary list of command-line options to the `con-duct plot` command on a per-example basis
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow tagging examples with multiple tags for categorization
- **FR-008**: System MUST assign each example a title
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate a README.md file that displays all examples with embedded plot images
- **FR-010**: System MUST create a tag index section in the README.md where each tag lists markdown hyperlinks to examples with that tag (e.g., "neuroimaging: [fMRIPrep 1.2.3](#fmriprep-123), [example2](#example2), ...")
- **FR-011**: System MUST generate anchor links that correctly reference example sections within the same README.md document
- **FR-012**: System MUST display source references (GitHub repo/DataLad dataset) for each example in the gallery
- **FR-013**: System MUST store plot images in SVG format alongside the gallery content
- **FR-014**: System MUST support both manually-created examples and examples discovered online
- **FR-015**: System MUST skip re-fetching examples that are already present locally
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide a force mode to re-fetch and regenerate examples regardless of local presence

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Example Entry**: Represents a single con/duct usage example; contains title, optional source reference (GitHub/DataLad URL), local or remote log file path, tags, plot options, and generated plot image paths
- **Example Registry**: Collection of all example entries; serves as the central index
- **Tag**: Categorization label applied to examples; enables grouping and organization
- **Source Reference**: Optional link to the origin of the con/duct log (GitHub repository URL or DataLad dataset identifier); may be empty for local-only examples
- **Plot Image**: Rendered visualization generated from a con/duct log file using `con-duct plot` command
- **Gallery Output**: The generated README.md file and associated images directory that forms the browseable gallery
